When an User submits a ticket they provide contact information along with any details related to the issue being experienced. If the organization has created a specific Help Topic that represents the issue it can be marked here. Once submitted the ticket is sent to the organization's inbox for Agents and Admins to review.

Agents and Admins are shown tickets in thier inbox tab. The inbox can be sorted using filters by priority, the assigned Agent, recent updates or a search bar can be used to find specific tickets.

</p>
<p>
Admins and Agents with permissions are able to update the tickets status as the issue is resolved. The SLA can be adjusted if a particular ticket's severity changes, the ticket can be assigned to specific Agents or Teams, and the User can recieve updates on their ticket as it's worked on. Once a ticket has been resolved the User will be able to see that from their account, and if auto-responses have been enabled by the organization then the User will recieve email notification as well.
